# MQTT_Project_Nitin
This project demonstrates a Python-based MQTT client-server system. The client sends random status messages to RabbitMQ every second. The server processes these messages, stores them in MongoDB, and provides a FastAPI endpoint to retrieve status counts within a specified time range.
